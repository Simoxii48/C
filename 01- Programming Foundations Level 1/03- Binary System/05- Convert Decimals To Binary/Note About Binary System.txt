Binary System Is So Powerful Because You Have One Option To have The Result You Want, Exemple:

	If You would like to represent 8 in Binary, you have direct bit with 8 in the value so :
		00001000 >>> This Is 8 Decimals In Binary.
	
	If You Don't Have A Direct Value like The Exemple, You Will Have 1 Option To Get Your Result:
	
	Exemple Of 21:
		00010101 >>> The Only Way To Get 21 In Binary Is This Result

That's The Power Of Binary System.
