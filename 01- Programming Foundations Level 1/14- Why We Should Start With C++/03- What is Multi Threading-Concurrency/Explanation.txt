Multithreading Or Concurrency Exemple :

	I Want A Program To Calculate 5 Different Students Marks.

	In Other Programming Language, It Will Calculate The First Students Mark, Once Its Done The Second, Then The Third, And So One To The Last.

	In C++ It's Different, Its The Same Program Will Run At The Same time As Much As You Need, In Our Exemple The Program Will Run 5 Times At The Same Time Calculate The 5 Different Marks Simultaneously.

	Multithreading Is Running A Lot Of Thing Parallelly.
